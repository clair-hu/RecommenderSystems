# Past, Present and Future

----
## Before "Recommender Systems"
* Manual Personalization
* Cross-Sales and Early Product Associations
* Product Search

----
## The Tech Bubble and the Burst
* Recommendation as key technology
* And then, Recommendation in Context

----
## Wave Two: The Netflix Prize
* New Excitement in Recommender Systems
 - Netflix $1,000,000 prize
 - Recommendation as an application area for **data mining, machine learning**
 - Rapid Growth in the Field
* New Techniques
 - Algorithm Stacking
 - New Matrix Factorization Techniques

----
## Mature Realizations
### Prediction and Basic Top-N Algorithms Limited
* Magic barriers - People themselves are too inconsistent and we need to work on getting people to be better. (You can't recommend more accurately without people being capable of rating.) 
* Value of Recommendation
* Context, Content, much more ...

----
## State of the Field Today
* Algorithms Well-Known
* Effective Recommendation Still a Craft
 - Exploring Data
 - Understanding Usage Cases and Value Proposition
* Still Largely Focused on Business Applications
 - Immense Creativity
 - Dream of Consumer-Owned not Realized

----
## Looking forward
### Many Hard Problems Unsolved
* Temporal recommendation
 - How do I key my recommendations not only to seasons which people have worked on for a while but to a sequence, what did you consume next given that you've consumed this already
* Recommendations for Education
* Low-Frequency, High-Stakes Recommendations

### Recognized Specialty that Brings Together
* Machine Learning / Data Mining
* Business / Marketing
* Human-Computer Interaction / Understanding Consumers

> Take a minute to think about why these examples are so challenging. Why is it harder to recommend along a time series (whether products like wine or education)? How much is this just a fundamental problem, and how much is just that you need lots more data (lots of people whoâ€™ve gone through every sequence? Similarly, why is it so hard to recommend surgeons in a personalized way? People trying to address these problems nearly all have to develop some sort of higher-level model of preferences (e.g., learning styles, preference models for medical care) because there is never enough data to learn those preferences from individual ratings or reactions.
