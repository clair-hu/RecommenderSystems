# Predictions and Recommendations

----
## Predictions
* Estimates of how much you'll like an item
 - Often scaled to match some rating scale
 - Often tied to search or browsing for specific products

## Prediction VS Recommendation
* Often, the two come together
* Predictions:
 - Pro: helps qualtify item
 - Con: provides something falsifiable
* Recommendations
 - Pro: provides good choices as a default
 - Con: if perceived as top-n, can result in failure to explore (if top few seem poor)
 
Q: Which of the following definitions best **distinguishes** predictions from recommendations?  
A: Predictions estimate a personâ€™s rating (or liking/consumption) of an item; recommendations select items for the person from a larger set.

## Another dimension to consider
* How explicit is the prediction or recommendation (**Explicit** vs. **Organic**)?
 - Historical note: we paid for it, we'll let you know
 - Today: balance between explicit prediction (falsifiable) and coarser granularity (you might like this!)
 - Today: balance between these are the best (top-n) and softer presentation (here are some that might be interesting)
 
> Cutomers did not always trust the recommender and often felt they were being pushed towards something and being manipulated.
> A softer presentation might have been a little bit better.
> For example, Amazon put recommendation in a more subtle organic presentation by placing things in Amazon tour with little more than you might like this.

### Following are true
* Organic presentations try to de-emphasize the prediction or recommendation.

* Recommendations can include both top-n lists and placement of recommended items at appropriate points on a page.

* It is possible to combine predictions and recommendations in the same interface.
